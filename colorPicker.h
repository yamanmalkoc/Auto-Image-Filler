     * For example, the gridColorPicker::operator()() function is defined so as
     * to return a color if x or y is divisible by the grid spacing, and white
     * otherwise. In this way, if you colored each pixel in an image whatever
     * color the gridColorPicker chose, you would end up with a grid.

     * @param y The y coordinate of the pixel we want to pick a color for.
